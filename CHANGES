automounter-1.5 (21 November 2013):
  - Add top-like monitor
  - Fix rc script if the amd(8) call is defined with arguments
  - Make the rc script FreeBSD 10 compatible
  - Add destdir (staging) support to the installer
  - Pretty print urlencoded labels like those produced by FreeBSD-10

automounter-1.4.7 (29 August 2013):
  - Allow configuring additional arguments for tool calls
  - Add read-only fallback for mounts to support mounting devices with
    hardware write protection
  - Fix display of 'automounter list mounted' for labeled devices
  - Log output to syslogd(8) via logger(1)

automounter-1.4.6 (18 August 2013):
  - Use amq(8) to interact with amd(8) instead of sending signals
  - Update the rc.d script to handle dependencies like /etc/rc.d/amd does
    on the supported FreeBSD release branches
  - Start rpcbind(8) during 'automounter start' if not yet running
  - Add two new return codes ERR_RPC_FAIL and ERR_AMD_FAIL
  - Use modern English style date headers in manual pages

automounter-1.4.5 (21 May 2013):
  - Fix devd race caused by new devd behaviour when probing devices on
    stable/9 that cannot be mounted, causing fork bomb like behaviour
  - Fix a sleepless loop condition in the geli detacher, which ate a core
    and acquired the lock at a high frequency
  - Prioritize iso9660 detection over label detection, leads to less
    confusing detection behaviour for optical media
  - Apply more groff_mdoc(7) foo to manual pages

automounter-1.4.4 (12 October 2010):
  - Fix kernel race, based on anonymous contribution, though I abused the
    situation to hone my awk skills.
  - Fix another kernel race, when label based detection is turned off.

automounter-1.4.3 (10 June 2010):
  - Remove all recursive update calls (rely on devd).
  - Remove update_delay.
  - Update devd configuration to follow label changes.
  - Change geliUpdate to use the fs probing code to fetch keys, and
    make the regular mounting synchronous to make updating less error prone.
  - Use labels for mounting when possible to avoid devd noise.
  - Allow empty c, w and l settings.
  - Only fork a single encrypted provider destroying process (instead of one
    for each udpate), because only the one succeeding terminates unless the
    key reappears.
  - Fix handling of devices with broken labels, was broken by the label change
    tracking.

automounter-1.4.2 (27 April 2010):
  - Track label changes gracefully.
  - Detect optical disc drives, even when no disc is present.
  - Add the detect_iso9660 switch and iso9660_devs pattern list.
  - Improve devd configuration file, i.e. improve auto update significantly.
  - Use stderr for error messages and warnings.

automounter-1.4.1 (14 April 2010):
  - Add detect_glabel and detect_probe switches to allow the deactivation of
    probing mechanisms.
  - Be more safe about not loosing mounted file systems.
  - Minor cleanups.
  - Add an IMPLEMENTATION NOTES section to the automounter(8) manual page.
  - Add a devd.conf file, so that manual setup of automatic USB discovery is
    not required.
  - Create less noisy output and return exit codes instead.
  - Handle the removal of mounted devices gracefully.
  - Add the mlist command for machine readable listing of media links and
    mount points.

automounter-1.4 (9 April 2010):
  - Fix a bug that made amd forget about active mounts if an update occured.
  - Clean up the code to add more device sources.
  - Add file system type to device link, e.g. "da1.msdosfs".
  - Add file system probing for unlabeled devices.

automounter-1.3.6 (3 April 2010):
  - Work around devices with an empty label.
  - Additionally offer access by device name instead of label.
  - Work around new glabel behaviour, that cause mounted nodes to disappear.
  - Remember managed nodes despite an unclean shutdown, so that a cleanup
    occurs during the next boot.
  - Also show fuse devices with the 'list mounted' command.
  - Remove redundant code.

automounter-1.3.5 (3 February 2010):
  - Block mounting by file system ID by default, because it works only once.
  - Remove the second license clause.

automounter-1.3.4 (13 August 2009):
  - Block umounts during file system activity, because it can cause tcsh to
    forget the current directory.
  - Update installer to install compressed manual pages.

automounter-1.3.3 (26 November 2008):
  - Some of the umount output is now hidden to keep the amd logfile small.
  - The script has been adjusted to be compatible with recent changes in sed
    that broke the handling of blacklists.

automounter-1.3.2 (02 September 2008):
  - A wrong requirement in the rc file was corrected.
  - The mount directories are now named like the device labels instead of using
    an md5 hash. This makes the mount and pwd commands much more readable.
    Only the amd internal identifiers remain md5 hashes to make up for its
    inabilty to handle spaces.

automounter-1.3.1 (20 May 2008):
  - To avoid stale NFS handles cd into the key location before attempting to
    attach an encrypted image/device.
  - Force start nfsclient and rpcbind on startup, to make amd work on machines
    not configured for nfs.

automounter-1.3 (18 April 2008):
  - The list images output has been fixed.
  - The list mounted output has been added to show mounted labels.
  - There is now a very evil workaround for the fusefs unmount bug.

automounter-1.2 (13 April 2008):
  - Automounter no longer uses camcontrol and atacontrol, this has several
    benefits, such as being able to mount memory disks and loosing the
    the restrictions on device blacklisting.
  - Automounter can now poll keys from managed file systems and automatically
    geli attach images and devices.

automounter-1.1 (06 April 2008):
  - The INSTALL file has been added to document the installation.
  - The update_delay option has been added.
  - To make everything label with spaces safe amd nodes now are md5 hashes.
  - Mount points now inherit the permissions of the device nodes. This is
    useful for msdosfs mounts.
  - The manual pages automounter(8) and automounter.conf(5) have both been
    updated.

automounter-1.0 (28 March 2008):
  - There are now default mount options for optical media that make sense.
  - The rc-script now supports the update parameter.

automounter-0.9 (26 March 2008):
  - First beta release, containing automounter, an rc-script, a sample
    configuration and the manual pages automounter(8) and automounter.conf(5).

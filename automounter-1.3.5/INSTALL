To install the scripts go into the src/ directory and run the command:
	./install.sh

The install script supports the following parameters, which are set in the
following way: -parameter=value

	-prefix=/usr/local
		The prefix that separates the files to be installed from the
		base system.

	-var=/var
		The directory to keep changing files. This influences the
		default of -run and -geli_images.

	-run=/var/run
		The directory where runtime information like the dynamically
		stored amd.map or PID files will be created.

	-media=/media
		The directory where the symlinks to the amd mounts will be
		created.

	-devfs=/dev
		The location of the device file system.

	-map=/etc/amd.map
		The location of the static amd.map that the dynamic one will
		be built upon.

	-amd=/usr/sbin/amd
		The location of the amd.

	-geli_images=/var/geli/images
		The location for geli images.

	-geli_keys=.geli/keys
		The location for geli keys on mountable media.

	-nodoc
		Set this to not install manual pages.

Be aware that install.sh and deinstall.sh have to be called with the same
parameters.

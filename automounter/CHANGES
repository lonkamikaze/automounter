automounter-1.4 (9 April, 2010):
  - Fix a bug that made amd forget about active mounts if an update occured.
  - Clean up the code to add more device sources.
  - Add file system type to device link, e.g. "da1.msdosfs".
  - Add file system probing for unlabeled devices.

automounter-1.3.6 (3 April, 2010):
  - Work around devices with an empty label.
  - Additionally offer access by device name instead of label.
  - Work around new glabel behaviour, that cause mounted nodes to disappear.
  - Remember managed nodes despite an unclean shutdown, so that a cleanup
    occurs during the next boot.
  - Also show fuse devices with the 'list mounted' command.
  - Remove redundant code.

automounter-1.3.5 (3 February, 2010):
  - Block mounting by file system ID by default, because it works only once.
  - Remove the second license clause.

automounter-1.3.4 (13 August, 2009):
  - Block umounts during file system activity, because it can cause tcsh to
    forget the current directory.
  - Update installer to install compressed manual pages.

automounter-1.3.3 (26 November, 2008):
  - Some of the umount output is now hidden to keep the amd logfile small.
  - The script has been adjusted to be compatible with recent changes in sed
    that broke the handling of blacklists.

automounter-1.3.2 (02 September, 2008):
  - A wrong requirement in the rc file was corrected.
  - The mount directories are now named like the device labels instead of using
    an md5 hash. This makes the mount and pwd commands much more readable.
    Only the amd internal identifiers remain md5 hashes to make up for its
    inabilty to handle spaces.

automounter-1.3.1 (20 May, 2008):
  - To avoid stale NFS handles cd into the key location before attempting to
    attach an encrypted image/device.
  - Force start nfsclient and rpcbind on startup, to make amd work on machines
    not configured for nfs.

automounter-1.3 (18 April, 2008):
  - The list images output has been fixed.
  - The list mounted output has been added to show mounted labels.
  - There is now a very evil workaround for the fusefs unmount bug.

automounter-1.2 (13 April, 2008):
  - Automounter no longer uses camcontrol and atacontrol, this has several
    benefits, such as being able to mount memory disks and loosing the
    the restrictions on device blacklisting.
  - Automounter can now poll keys from managed file systems and automatically
    geli attach images and devices.

automounter-1.1 (06 April, 2008):
  - The INSTALL file has been added to document the installation.
  - The update_delay option has been added.
  - To make everything label with spaces safe amd nodes now are md5 hashes.
  - Mount points now inherit the permissions of the device nodes. This is
    useful for msdosfs mounts.
  - The manual pages automounter(8) and automounter.conf(5) have both been
    updated.

automounter-1.0 (28 March, 2008):
  - There are now default mount options for optical media that make sense.
  - The rc-script now supports the update parameter.

automounter-0.9 (26 March, 2008):
  - First beta release, containing automounter, an rc-script, a sample
    configuration and the manual pages automounter(8) and automounter.conf(5).

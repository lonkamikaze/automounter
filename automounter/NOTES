This minor release adds more graceful handling of "disappearing" file systems
(i.e. USB sticks that have been unplugged while mounted) and the mlist command
that issues some machine readable path information about available file
systems and mounted file systems.

- automounter 1.4.1

 * Tested on FreeBSD 8.0-STABLE
 Please run 'man 8 automounter' and 'man 5 automounter.conf' for introductions.

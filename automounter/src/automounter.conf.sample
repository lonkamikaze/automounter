# This file contains examples for configuring automounter(8). Read the
# automounter.conf(5) manual page to learn all the possibilities.

###
# Enable geli key polling and auto attaching.
#

#geli=1

###
# The automounter aquires a lock to prevent simultaneous calls of the script
# from interfering with each other. Aquiring the lock can timeout. The default
# is 10 seconds, set this to 0 to skip if the lock cannot be aquired
# immediately.
#

#timeout=10

###
# The automounter uses amd(8) to actually mount the identified mounts.
# By default automounter tunes the cache and wait time of amd aggressively
# towards early unmounting. Increase these values to be less aggressive.
#

#c=2
#w=1

###
# You can change the directory that is populated with mountpoints, e.g. to
# avoid clashes with HAL-based solutions.
#

#linkdir="%%MEDIA%%"

###
# The following line reduces the probability of data corruption when removing
# mounted media by activating synced I/O. Due to the extreme performance
# punishment this is and will not be the default.
#

#mount_options=$mount_options,sync

### 
# Uncomment the following tu use the fusefs ntfs implemention of the NTFS file
# system, with root:operater 0775 access for directories and 0664 for files.
#

#ntfs=ntfs-3g
#ntfs_options=rw,noatime,gid=5,umask=113,dmask=002,locale=en_GB.UTF-8

###
# Uncomment the following line to activate a very evil bug workaround for
# fuse based mounts (e.g. ntfs-3g). If more than one fuse file system
# is mounted at a time, this will lead to unexpected results.
#
# With this workaround in place any fuse based file system will only be
# unmounted if ALL fuse based file systems are free for unmounting.
#
# Without this workaround all files in a fuse based file system will be closed
# whenever amd tries to unmount. With the default settings that means
# every second.
#

#evil_fuse=1

###
# The following options cause msdosfs mounts to be treated as UTF-8 encoded
# and make sure that files do not get the executable bit, while directories
# keep it.
#

#msdosfs_options=$mount_options,-L=en_GB.UTF-8,-m660,-M770

###
# Blacklist certain devices or nodes, separated by ','.
# This is useful to except nodes that are already handled elsewhere,
# e.g. in the static amd map or in the fstab(5) file.
#
# These are shell patterns. Don't forget to quote or escape stuff.
#

#blacklist_devs="ad*,acd*"
#blacklist_nodes="ufs/*"

BSDAdminScripts is a collection of administrative shell scripts for FreeBSD.
It started from a selection of shell scripts I wrote for my personal use,
but has since outgrown this heritage.

At the moment everything is licensed under a single clause BSD license. I simply
took the license from the FreeBSD project and removed the clauses I do not
need.

I try to maintain compatibilty to older versions with every update, also the
code is heavily commented. Feel free to read it, point out bugs, make
suggestions or just get some inspiration for your own scripts. I'm constantly
learning new cool stuff you can do in a shell script.

I am a computer science student at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences
and a member of the BSDForen.de team.

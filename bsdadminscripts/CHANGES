   - Attempt downloads from all mirrors before falling back to downloading
     from the master server.
   - Optionally record package messages in a file.
   - Try to install packages with missing files again, this deals with problems

   - Add pkg_upgrade.conf to set pkg_upgrade specific environment variables.
   - Allow to install package files directly.

bsdadminscripts-6.1.1 (9 May 2009):
 - uma version 1.1 to 1.1.1
   - A bug in the branch detection that caused it to always detect stable
     was fixed.

bsdadminscripts-6.1 (7 May 2009):
 - installer
   - Add DATADIR support.
 - uma version 1.0 to 1.1
   - Provides environment variables with package download mirrors.
   - Use the BRANCH environment variable to override branch detection.
 - pkg_upgrade version 1.0 to 1.1
   - A download manager does early, parallel background downloading from the
     mirrors provided by uma.
   - Now locks on to PKG_DBDIR to keep ports from manipulating the package
     database.
   - The upwards dependency checking speed has been improved significantly.
   - Many small performance improvements.

bsdadminscripts-6.0 (26 April 2009):
 - Fix and improve the verbose output of distviper.
 - Fix return code upon successful distviper completion.
 - Code cleanups in pkg_libchk, pkg_validate, portconfig and rcstart.
 - The uma (update manager) script is now part of the collection. It provides
   locking and common update operations for port and package tools to allow
   coexistance and consistency between them.
 - The pkg_upgrade script is now part of the collection. It allows binary
   only updates, keeping the package database consistent.
 - Switch to a single clause license. The binary distribution clause was
   dropped.
 - Fix typo in bsdadminscripts.1 manual page.
 - The SUBTHREADS setting of the buildflags framework has been deprecated.
 - The buildflags.conf.sample file has been updated.
 - Cleanups of all manual pages.
 - The install.sh script now installs compressed manual pages by default.

bsdadminscripts-5.0 (27 January 2009):
 - The distviper script that wipes outdated files from the distdir of the
   FreeBSD ports system has been added.

bsdadminscripts-4.4.4 (12 January 2009):
  - The pkg_libchk script manual page now contains a note on avoiding obsolete
    output.

bsdadminscripts-4.4.3 (11 September 2008):
  - The pkg_libchk script now works around several ldd bugs listed in the
    FreeBSD PR database as amd64/127275 and amd64/127276.

bsdadminscripts-4.4.2 (13 April 2008):
  - Fixes a bug in the install script that causes buildflags.awk to fail.
  - The output of pkg_validate has been cleaned up.

bsdadminscripts-4.4.1 (6 April 2008):
  - New install.sh and deinstall.sh script.
  - Most hard-coded locations have been removed from all scripts.
    They can be set by the install script. See INSTALL for details.

bsdadminscripts-4.4 (22 March 2008):
  - Fix provide keywords with trailing spaces and get rid of '-e' not found
    messages in the rcstart script.
  - Use shell substring processing where appropriate in rcstart, portconfig,
    pkg_validate and pkg_libchk.
  - Allow using delimiters longer than one character in raw printing mode in
    pkg_validate.
  - Status messages in pkg_libchk are now always directed to the terminal,
    even when output is redirected into a file or pipe. Because of this -q
    does no longer implicate -c.
  - Status messages in pkg_validate are now also always directed to the
    terminal. Because of this -r does no longer suppress status messages and
    -c has been introduced to compensate for that.

bsdadminscripts-4.3 (10 March 2008):
  - Fix inifinite loop in pkg_libchk when giving unknown parameters in a chain.
  - Add support for native make(1) directives to buildflags.
  - The pkg_libchk script now runs two parallel jobs per CPU core.
    Testing shows that due to the overhead created by locking mechanisms and
    job management the script runtime has increased by 4% on Single-Core
    machines. A runtime decrease of 35% can be expected on Dual-Core setups.
    Other setups have not been tested.
  - The parameter -jN was introduced to pkg_libchk to allow setting the desired
    number of parallel jobs.
  - The pkg_validate script has been subject to a code audit.
  - The rcstart script has been subject to a code audit.
  - The portconfig script has been subject to a code audit.
  - The portconfig script can now do more than 9 retries.

bsdadminscripts-4.2 (12 February 2008):
  - The file THANKS has been created.
  - The pkg_libchk script introduces the parameters -c and -v for clean
    and verbose output.
  - The pkg_libchk script introduces the parameter -n to avoid detecting
    compat libraries as missing libraries.
  - The pkg_libchk false positive detecting code has been highly improved.
    The script is now faster and more accurate.
  - The portconfig scripts now hides an error message that was previously
    printed, even though the situation was correctly handled by the script.

bsdadminscripts-4.1.1 (4 February 2008):
  - Minor bug in the new port matching behaviour of portconfig corrected.

bsdadminscripts-4.1 (2 February 2008):
  - Some checks in buildflags.mk have been corrercted.
  - The portconfig script no longer uses portupgrade. It still tries to copy
    the port matching behaviour of portupgrade, so there should be no
    recognizable change apart from increased performance.

bsdadminscripts-4.0 (26 October 2007):
  - The pkg_libchk script has been introduced.
  - The pkg_validate status message does not flicker any more.
  - The pkg_validate script now terminates after receiving ^C. 
  - The buildflags.mk file has been updated to handle the combination of
    ccache and distcc in a way that allows ccache to recognize compiler
    changes and not to mistake distcc changes for them.

bsdadminscripts-3.0 (17 June 2007):
  - All manual pages have received small improvements.
  - The pkg_validate script has been added to the collection.
  - The buildflags.conf example has been updated.

bsdadminscripts-2.1.4 (9 June 2007):
  - The rcstart script now executes rc_conf_files set in /etc/defaults/rc.conf.
  - The portconfig script now omits the package database consistency checking
    of portupgrade.
  - The buildflags.mk magic now deals with ports that remember the number of
    threads from the configure stage, which can lead to a failed install.

bsdadminscripts-2.1.3 (2 May 2007):
  - The buildflags.mk magic now works even if a buildflags.conf is not
    present.

bsdadminscripts-2.1.2 (13 September 2006):
  - Portconfig now attempts to to act even if portupgrade returned an error.
  - SUBTHREADS now only works if install is not specified, due to many
    FreeBSD ports compiling, but not installing properly. This will not
    affect you when you use portupgrade or a similar tool to update your
    software.
  - Some corrections to the buildflags.conf(1) man page.
  - Some corrections to the buildflags.awk(1) man page.

bsdadminscripts-2.1.1 (3 August 2006):
  - Some small fixes to the buildflags framework.

bsdadminscripts-2.1 (19 July 2006):
  - The script buildflags.sh has been replaced with buildflags.awk.
    The new script is backwards compatible, but a lot faster, with
    cleaner code and has been rid of some limitations of the old script.
  - All the man pages have been moved to the man 1 category, because
    that seems to be the place where all other similar projects put them.
  - The buildflags.conf man page has become more complete.
  - The sample buildflags.conf has been replaced with a configuration that
    is really in use.

bsdadminscripts-2.0 (14 July 2006):
  - The buildflags framework to control location dependant build flags
    has been introduced.
  - The --help flag of rcstart and portconfig has been castrated in favour
    of the new man pages.
  - The rcstart script now surpresses error messages caused by empty rc.d
    folders.

bsdadminscripts-1.1 (30 May 2006):
  - The portconfig script has been rid of all 'grep -o' calls for FreeBSD 4.x
    compatibility.
  - The rcstart script has been rid of all 'grep -o' calls for FreeBSD 4.x
    compatibility.

bsdadminscripts-1.0 (14 May 2006):
  - The rcstart script now treats service names as regular expressions and
    applies the command on all matching services.
  - The code in portconfig that parses the output of portupgrade has been
    rewritten to make it easier maintainable.

bsdadminscripts-0.9 (12 April 2006):
  - Initial release, containing portconfig and rcstart.

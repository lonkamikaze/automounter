This file contains a list of people I want to express my gratitude to.

- Markus Schoepke and his employer webstyle (April 21, 2009)
For intense testing and feedback as well as providing me with a 
dual quad-core machine for my own testing. On this machine I found
and fixed numerous bugs in the conflict handling and package name
recognition. The extensive testing also helped me optimize the output,
so that a user hopefully does not come to think missing dependencies
reported by pkg_add are simply ignored.
http://www.webstyle.ch is a provider of FreeBSD based hosting solutions.

- Hannes Hauswedell (April 21, 2009)
For specifying the concept and requirements for UMA.
Hannes Hauswedell is the originator of the KPorts project and a member of
the BSDForen.de team.
The KPorts project can be found at http://kports.sf.net/.

- pit234a from the BSDForen.de community  (January 29, 2009)
For pointing out an error in distviper.

- *Sheep and pit234a from the BSDForen.de community (January 26, 2009)
For suggesting the name distviper in a massive brainstorming effort of the
BSDForen.de community.

- E. J. Cerejo (February 12, 2008)
For tirelessly testing pkg_libchk and with his feedback allowing me to
highly improve the false positive checking and thus making it a more
accurate and useful tool.
This has lead to the changes from version 1.0 to 1.2 of pkg_libchk.

- George L. Yermulnik (May 30, 2006)
For testing, feedback and providing patches to make rcstart FreeBSD 4
compatible.
This has lead to the changes from version 1.0 to 1.1 of rcstart.

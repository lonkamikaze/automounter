#
# 1) DEFINING CLASSES
#
# This section describes the creation of classes.
#
# NOTE:	The details of creating classes are listed in front of the
#	bsda:obj:createClass() function.
#
# Creating a class consists of two steps, the first step is to call
# the bsda:obj:createClass() function, the second one is to implement the
# methods. This section describes the first step.
#
# In order to create classes this framework has to be loaded:
#
#	. ./bsda_obj.sh
#
# 1.1) Basic Class Creation
#
# Creating a class does not require more than a class name:
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass MyClass
#
# After the previous line the class can be used to create objects,
# however useless, and all the reserved methods are available:
#
#	MyClass myObject
#	$myObject.delete
#
# It is possible to create classes as simple data structures, that do not
# require the programmer to write any methods to function:
#
# 	bsda:obj:createClass MyPoint2D \
#		w:name \
#		w:x \
#		w:y
#
# Instances of the MyPoint2D class now offer the getName() and setName(),
# getX() and setX(), getY() and setY() methods:
#
#	MyPoint2D point
#	$point.setName "upper left corner"
#	$point.setX 0
#	$point.setY 0
#
# It might be a good idea to add an init method to the class in order to
# assign values:
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass MyConstPoint2D \
#		i:init \
#		r:name \
#		r:x \
#		r:y
#	
#	MyConstPoint2D.init() {
#		[ ... assign values, maybe even check types ... ]
#	}
#
# NOTE:	The init method can have an arbitrary name.
#
# Note that the attributes were now created with "r:", this means they only
# have get methods, no set methods. All the values are now assigned during
# object creation by the init method:
#
#	MyConstPoint2D corner "upper right corner" 640 0
#
# 1.2) Inheritance
#
# If a similar class is required there is no reason to start anew, the
# previous class can be extended:
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass MyConstPoint3D extends:MyConstPoint2D \
#		i:init \
#		r:z
#	
#	MyConstPoint3D.init() {
#		# Call the init method of the parent class.
#		$class.superInit "$1" "$2" "$3" || return 1
#		# Check whether the given coordinate is an integer.
#		bsda:obj:isInt "$4" || return 1
#		setvar ${this}z "$4"
#	}
#
# The init method is explicitely stated in the class declaration just for the
# sake of readability, though not a requirement for overloading inherited
# methods, this is considered good style.
#
# NOTE: If the init method does not return 0 the object is instantly
#	destroyed and the return value is forwarded to the caller.
#	The caller then has a reference to a no longer existing object
#	and does not know about it, unless the return value of the
#	constructor is checked.
#
# Multiple inheritance is possible, but should be used with great care,
# because there are several limits. If several extended classes provide
# the same method, the method of the first class has the priority.
#
# The super init and cleanup methods are those of the first class providing
# an init or cleanup method.
# The remaining init and cleanup methods might continue to exist as regular
# methods, if their names do not conflict.
#
# Inherited methods become part of a class. Thus inherited private methods
# are readily available to every method of the class, even new methods or
# methods inherited from different classes.
#
# It also means that even instances of the originating class do not have
# access to private methods. This behaviour contradicts common expectations.
# The different paradigm is that access scope in this framework manages
# access to the current context instead of access to certain code.
#
# 1.3) Access Scope
#
# You might want to limit access to certain methods, for this you can
# add the scope operators private, protected and public. If no scope
# operator is given, public is assumed.
#
# public:
# 	This scope allows access from anywhere.
# protected:
#	The protected scope allows classes that are derived from the
#	current class, parents of the corrunt class or reside within
#	the same namespace access.
# private:
#	Only instances of the same class have access.
#
# Namespaces are colon (the character ":") seperated. E.g. the class
# bsda:pkg:Index has the namespace "bsd:pkg".
#
# The scope operator is added after the identifier type prefix. Only
# prefixes that declare methods can have a scope operator.
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass myNs:Person \
#		i:private:init \
#		w:private:familyName \
#		w:private:firstName
#
# NOTE:	The constructor is always public. Declaring a scope for an init method
#	only affects direct calls of the method.
#
# Now the getters and setters for both familyName and firstName are private.
# It is possible to widen the scope of a method by redeclaring it.
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass myNs:Person \
#		i:private:init \
#		w:private:familyName \
#		x:public:getFamilyName \
#		w:private:firstName \
#		x:public:getFirstName
#
# NOTE:	When methods are inherited the widest declared scope always wins, no
# 	matter from which class it originates.
#
# 1.4) Interfaces
#
# Implementations of generic solutions normally require the classes using them
# to conform to a certain interface (e.g. in a listener and notify pattern).
#
# Technically this can be realized with inheritance, but this is often a dirty
# solution, especially when conformance to several interfaces is required.
#
# To circumvent the consistency problems imposed by multiple inheritance the
# bsda:obj:createInterface() method allows the creation of interfaces:
#
#	bsda:obj:createInterface Listener \
#		x:notify
#
# NOTE:	Methods defined by an interface are always public, so there is not
#	scope operator.
#
# NOTE:	Interfaces cannot be used to define attributes.
#
# Every class conforming to the interface has to implement the methods defined
# by the interface:
#
#	bsda:obj:createClass Display implements:Listener \
#		[ ... additional method and attribute definitions ... ]
#
#	Display.notify() {
#		[ ... ]
#	}
#
# Interfaces can also extend other interfaces.
#
# To check whether an object is derived from a class conforming to an
# interface the static isInstance method can be use:
#
#	if ! Listener.isInstance $object; then
#		[ ... ]
#	fi
#

#
# 2) IMPLEMENTING METHODS
#
# All that remains to be done to get a functional class after defining it,
# is to implement the required methods.
# Methods are really just functions that the constructor
# creates a wrapper for that forwards the object reference to them.
#
# 2.1) Regular Methods
#
# The following special variables are available:
# 	this	A reference to the current object
#	class	The name of the class this object is an instance of
#	caller	Provides access to methods to manipulate the caller context,
#		which is the recommended way of returning data to the caller
#
# The following methods are offered by the caller:
#	setvar	Sets a variable in the caller context.
#	getObject
#		Returns a reference to the calling object.
#	getClass
#		Returns the name of the calling class.
#
# The following variable names may not be used in a method:
#	_return
#	_var
#	_setvars
#
# A method must always be named "<class>.<method>". So a valid implementation
# for a method named "bar" and a class named "foo" would look like this:
#
#	foo.bar() {
#	}
#
# The object reference is always available in the variable "this", which
# performs the same function as "self" in python or "this" in Java.
#
# Attributes are resolved as "<objectId><attribute>", the following example
# shows how to read an attribute, manipulate it and write the new value.
# Directly operating on attributes is not possible.
#
#	foo.bar() {
#		local count
#		# Get counter value.
#		bsda:obj:getVar count ${this}count
#		# Increase counter value copy.
#		count=$(($count + 1))
#		# Store the counter value.
#		setvar ${this}count $count
#	}
#
# The following example does the same with getters and setters. Getters and
# setters are documented in chapter 7 and 8.
#
#	foo.bar() {
#		local count
#		# Get counter value.
#		$this.getCount count
#		# Increase counter value copy.
#		count=$(($count + 1))
#		# Store the counter value.
#		$this.setCount $count
#	}
#
# To return data into the calling context $caller.setvar is used. It
# provides the possibility to overwrite variables in the caller context
# even when there is a local variable using the same name.
# Note that it has to be assumed that the names of variables used within
# a method are unknown to the caller, so this can always be the case.
#
# The name of the variable to store something in the caller context is
# normally given by the caller itself as a parameter to the method call.
#
# The following method illustrates this, the attribute count is fetched
# and returned to the caller through the variable named in $1.
# Afterwards the attribute is incremented:
#
#	foo.countInc() {
#		local count
#		# Get counter value.
#		$this.getCount count
#		$caller.setvar $1 $count
#		# Increase counter value copy.
#		count=$(($count + 1))
#		# Store the counter value.
#		$this.setCount $count
#	}
#
# This is how a call could look like:
#
#	local count
#	$obj.countInc count
#	echo "The current count is $count."
#
# Note that both the method and the caller use the local variable count, yet by
# using $caller.setvar the method is still able to overwrite count in the
# caller context.
#
# If a method uses no local variables (which is only sensible in very rare
# cases), the regular shell builtin setvar can be used to overwrite variables
# in the caller context to reduce overhead.
#
# 2.2) Special Methods
#
# There are two special kinds of methods available, init and cleanup methods.
# These methods are special, because they are called implicitely, the first
# when an object is created, the second when it is reset or deleted.
#
# The init method is special because the $caller.setvar() method is not
# available. It is called by the constructor with all values apart from the
# first one, which is the variable the constructor stores the object
# reference in. It can also be called directly (e.g. after a call to the
# reset() method).
#
# The purpose of an init method is to initialize attributes during class
# creation. If the current class is derived from another class it might
# be a good idea to call the init method of the parent class. This is
# done by calling $class.superInit().
#
# If the init method fails (returns a value > 0) the constructor immediately
# destroys the object.
#
# The cleanup method is called implicitely by the delete() and reset()
# methods. Unlike the init method it has all the posibilities of an
# ordinary method.
#
# Both the delete() and reset() methods do not proceed if the cleanup
# method fails.
#

#
# 3) CONSTRUCTOR
#
# This block documents the use of a constructor created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# The name of the class acts as the name of the constructor. The first
# parameter is the name of a variable to store the object reference in.
# An object reference is a unique id that allows the accessing of all methods
# belonging to an object.
#
# The object id is well suited for "grep -F", which is nice to have when
# implementing lists.
#
# The following example shows how to create an object of the type "foo:bar",
# by calling the "foo:bar" constructor:
#
#	foo:bar foobar
#
# The following example shows how to use a method belonging to the object:
#
#	$foobar.copy foobarCopy
#
# @param 1
#	The name of the variable to store the reference to the new object in.
# @param @
#	The remaining parameters are forwarded to an init method,
#	if one was specified.
# @return
#	Returns 0 for success and higher values for failure. If the
#	init method has a fail case, this should be checked, because
#	the object is not created in case of a failure.
#

#
# 4) RESET
#
# This block documents the use of a resetter created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# The resetter first calls the cleanup method with all parameters, if one
# has been defined. Afterwards it simply removes all attributes from memory.
#
# NOTE:	The destruction of attributes is avoided when the cleanup method fails.
#
# The resetter does not call the init method afterwards, because it would
# not be possible to provide different parameters to the init and cleanup
# methods in that case.
#
# The following example shows how to reset an object referenced by "foobar".
#
#	$foobar.reset
#
# @param @
#	The parameters are forwareded to a cleanup() method if one was
#	specified.
#

#
# 5) DESTRUCTOR
#
# This block documents the use of a destructor created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# The destructor calls a cleanup method with all parameters, if
# one was specified. Afterwards it simply removes all method wrappers and
# attributes from memory.
#
# NOTE:	The destruction of attributes and method wrappers is avoided when
#	the cleanup method fails.
#
# The following example illustrates the use of the destructor on an object
# that is referenced by the variable "foobar".
#
#	$foobar.delete
#
# @param @
#	The parameters are forwareded to a cleanup() method if one was
#	specified.
#

#
# 6) COPY
#
# This block documents the use of a copy method created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# The copy method creates a new object of the same type and copies all
# attributes over to the new object.
#
# The following exampe depicts the copying of an object referenced by the
# variable "foobar". The new object will be referenced by the variable
# "foobarCopy".
#
#	$foobar.copy foobarCopy
#

#
# 7) GET
#
# This block documents the use of a getter method created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# A getter method either outputs an attribute value to stdout or stores it
# in a variable, named by the first parameter.
#
# The following example shows how to get the attribute "value" from the object
# referenced by "foobar" and store it in the variable "value".
#
#	$foobar.getValue value
#
# @param 1
#	The optional name of the variable to store the attribute value in.
#	If ommitted the value is output to stdout.
#

#
# 8) SET
#
# This block documents the use of a setter method created by the
# bsda:obj:createClass() function below.
#
# A setter method stores a value in an attribute.
#
# This example shows how to store the value 5 in the attribute "value" of
# the object referenced by "foobar".
#
#	$foobar.setValue 5
#
# @param 1
#	The value to write to an attribute.
#

#
# 9) TYPE CHECKS
#
# This framework supplies basic type checking facilities.
#
# 9.1) Object Type Checks
#
# This block documents the use of the static type checking method created
# by the bsda:obj:createClass() and bsda:obj:createInterface() function below.
#
# The type checking method isInstance() takes an argument string and checks
# whether it is a reference to an object of this class.
#
# This example shows how to check whether the object "foobar" is an instance
# of the class "foo:bar".
#
#	if foo:bar.isInstance $foobar; then
#		...
#	else
#		...
#	fi
#
# @param 1
#	Any string that might be a reference.
#
# 9.2) Primitive Type Checks
#
# The following primitive type checking functions are available and documented
# below:
#	bsda:obj:isObject()
#	bsda:obj:isInt()
#	bsda:obj:isUInt()
#	bsda:obj:isFloat()
#	bsda:obj:isSimpleFloat()
#

#
# 10) SERIALIZE
#
# This documents the process of serialization and deserialization.
# Serialization is the process of turning data structures into string
# representations. Serialized objects can be stored in a file and reloaded
# at a later time. They can be passed on to other processess, through a file
# or a pipe. They can even be transmitted over a network through nc(1).
#
# NOTE:	Static attributes are not subject to serialization.
#
# 10.1) Serializing
#
# The following example serializes the object $foobar and stores the string
# the variable serialized.
#
#	$foobar.serialize serialized
#
# The next example saves the object $configuration in a file.
#
#	$configuration.serialize > ~/.myconfig
#
# If $configuration references other objects it will fail to access them
# if deserialized in a new context.
# This is what the serializeDeep() method is good for. It serializes entire
# data structures recursively and is the right choice in many use cases.
# It is used in exactly the same way as the serialize method.
#
#	$configuration.serializeDeep > ~/.myconfig
#
# @param 1
#	If given it is used as the variable name to store the serialized string
#	in, otherwise the serialized string is output to stdout.
#
# 10.2) Deserializing
#
# This example loads the object $configuration from a file and restores it.
#
#	# Deserialize the data and get the object reference.
#	bsda:obj:deserialize configuration - < ~/.myconfig
#
# After the last line the $configuration object can be used exactly like
# in the previous session.
#
# Serialized data is executable shell code that can be fed to eval, however
# the bsda:obj:deserialize() function should always be used to ensure that
# deserialization happens in a controlled environment.
#
# @param 1
#	The name of the variable to store the object ID (reference) of the
#	serialized object in.
# @param 2
#	This is expected to be a serialized string. In the special case that
#	this parameter is a dash (the charachter "-"), the serialized string
#	will be read from stdin.
#

#
# 11) FORKING PROCESSES
#
# One of the intended uses of serializing is that a process forks and both
# processes are able to pass new or updated objects to each others and thus
# keep each other up to date.
#
# When a process is forked, both processes retain the same state, the only
# difference is the parent process now has $! set to the PID of the new child.
#
# This means the forked process does not know its own PID ($$ still holds the
# PID of the parent process) and thus both processes are in danger of
# createing objects with identical IDs. As soon as these get passed on, they
# overwrite each other.
#
# The function bsda:obj:fork() can be used to circumvent this problem. The
# bsda:obj framework reads the process ID from the variable bsda_obj_pid,
# which is initialized with $$. The bsda:obj:fork() function can be used to
# update the variable in a forked process.
#
# The following example illustrates its use.
#
#	(
#		bsda:obj:fork
#		# Do something ...
#	) &
#	bsda:obj:fork $!
#
# It might also be desirable for some applications to know their PID, reading
# it from bsda_obj_pid instead of $$ solves this problem if the bsda:obj:fork()
# functions is used.
#

#
# 12) REFLECTION & REFACTORING
#
# The bsda:obj framework offers full reflection. Refactoring is not supported,
# but possible to a limited degree.
#
# Internally the reflection support is required for realizing inheritance.
# A new class tells all its parents "I'm one of yours" and takes all the
# methods and attributes for itself.
#
# 12.1) Attributes
#
# Each class offers the static method getAttributes():
#
#	<classname>.getAttributes attributes
#
# The variable attributes then contains a list of all attributes an instance
# of this class has. The list is newline separated.
#
# Every attribute of an instance can directly be accessed, bypassing the scope
# checks (object is an instance of the class the list attributes was
# determined from):
#
#	for attribute in $attributes; do
#		echo $attribute:
#		# Print the attribute value
#		bsda:obj:getVar $object$attribute
#	done
#
# 12.2) Methods
#
# Each class also offers the static method getMethods():
#
#	<classname>.getMethods methods
#
# The methods variable in the example then contains a list of methods in the
# format:
#
#	("private" | "protected" | "public") + ":" + <methodname>
#
# The methods are newline separated.
#
# Every method can be overwritten, by redefining it. The access scope checks
# remain the same. To access a private or protected method of an unrelated
# object, the class and identity of the caller can be faked by rewriting the
# class and this special variables:
#
#	# Preserve context
#	local tmpThis tmpClass
#	tmpThis="$this"
#	tmpClass="$class"
#
#	# Call forbidden method
#	this=$object
#	class=<objectclass>
#	$object.<methodname>
#
#	# Restore context
#	this=$tmpThis
#	class=$tmpClass
#
# 12.3) Parent Classes and Interfaces
#
# Each class knows its parents and interfaces and reveals them through the
# static getParents() and getInterfaces() methods:
#
#	<classname>.getInterfaces interfaces
#	<classname>.getParents parents
#
# The variables interfaces and parents contain newline separated lists of
# interface and class names after the preceding commands.
#
# Though all classes know their parents, they do not know their children.
# Instead there is a recognition pattern for object IDs belonging to the
# class, which is used by the static isInstance() method for each class.
#
# Every inheriting/implementing class adds a pattern for itself to the
# recognition pattern of each class and interface it extends and implements.
# This pattern can be accessed through the class prefix:
#
#	<classname>.getPrefix prefix
#	bsda:obj:getVar patterns ${prefix}instancePatterns
#
# The class prefix can also be used to access the code for the access scope
# checks. This can be abused to deactivate theses checks for a certain class:
#
#	unset ${prefix}public ${prefix}protected ${prefix}private
#

#
# 13) COMPATIBILITY
#
# This framework was written for the bourne shell clone, provided with the
# FreeBSD operating system (a descendant of the Almquist shell). To open it
# up to a wider audience it was made compatible to the bourne again shell
# (bash) version 4, though it is likely to work with earlier releases, too.
#
# The performance of bash however is very bad (more than thrice the runtime
# of FreeBSD's ASH derivate for the tested cases). Unfortunately the only
# popular ASH derivate in the GNU world, dash, is not compatible.
# Compatibility could be achieved, but the syntactical impact was deemed too
# painful.
#
# The serialization relies on external commands that might not be present
# everywhere, namely b64encode(1) and b64decode(1)
#
# Compatibilty hacks can be found at the very end of the file. This chapter
# describes some of the differences between FreeBSD sh and bash that one
# might have to keep in mind when implementing classes with this framework.
#
# 13.1) POSIX
#
# The relatively strict POSIX conformance of dash is the reason that this
# framework is not compatible to it. The specific reason why this framework
# does not work with dash is the use of colon ':' and period '.' characters
# in function and method names. POSIX only requires a shell to support
# function names consisting of the character group [_[:alnum:]].
# http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_09_05
#
# However it also states that a shell may allow other characters. The
# resulting paradox is that supporting colons and periods in function names
# is POSIX conformant, whereas using them isn't.
#
# One might argue that POSIX conformance should be the top priority to a
# general purpose framework such as this one. An example for an object
# oriented shell framework doing just that is Shoop, which originates from
# the Debian project.
# http://shoop.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/shoop/shoop/docs/README?view=markup
#
# Shoop is a good example why POSIX support is only of secondary concern for
# the bsda:obj development. Using Shoop neither feels like writing shell code
# nor like using one of the popular OO languages.
#
# Preserving the shell scripting "feeling" and introducing similarities to
# popular OO languages were the main syntactical goals for bsda:obj.
# These goals were not compatible to the goal of full POSIX conformance and
# took precendence.
#
# A good example why POSIX conformance is overrated is the local function.
# POSIX neither requires nor defines it. Arguably large shell scripts
# would become very tedious, considering that all variables would then
# be global and their names would have to be chosen with extraordinary care.
#
# Even dash with its strict POSIX conformance knows the local builtin.
# Considering that, one might argue it should add colon and period support for
# function names as well, because the . and : builtin functions imply that
# . and : are valid function names.
#
# 13.2) bash - local
#
# The local command of bash destroys the original variable values when
# declaring a variable local. Most notably that broke scope checks.
# A simple workaround was to move the local decleration behind the scope
# checks in the code.
#
# 13.3) bash - setvar
#
# The bash doesn't have a setvar command. A hack was introduced to circumvent
# this.
#
# 13.4) bash - Command Substitution Variable Scope
#
# Variable changes inside command substition are lost outside the scope of the
# substition, when using bash. The FreeBSD sh performs command substitution in
# the same variable scope, which sometimes can be used for elegant solutions,
# where bash compatibility requires the use of additional temporary variables.
#
# The following code will output "ab" when executed by FreeBSD-sh and "aa"
# when executed with bash:
#
#	test=a
#	echo $test$(test=b)$test
#
# 13.5) bash - alias
#
# The alias command in bash, used for inheritance in the framework, only works
# in interactive mode. Hence all uses of alias had to be substituted with
# slightly slower function wrappers.
#

#
# This is a user tunable to turn off scope checks, which can bring
# considerable performance gain, but should only be done with thoroughly
# tested code.
#
# It has to be activated before including the framework. Changing it at
# runtime will have no effect.

#	getAttributes()
#	getMethods()
#	getPrefix()
#	getInit()
#	getClean()
#	getParents()
#	getInterfaces()
#
# The following methods are reserved:
#	copy()
#	delete()
#	reset()
#	serialize()
#	serializeDeep()
#
# The following class prefix bound static attributes are reserved:
#	instancePatterns
#	private
#	protected
#	public
#
# The following session, class and process bound static attributes are
# reserved:
#	nextId
#
# @param 1
#	The first parameter is the name of the class.
# @param @
#	A description of the class to create.
#	
#	All parameters following the class name make up a list of identifiers
#	for attributes and methods. Every identifier has a prefix, the
#	following prefixes are supported:
#
#		-: A plain attribute.
#		r: An attribute with a get method. The identifier
#		   "r:foo" results in a method called "getFoo".
#		w: An attribute with a get and set method. "w:foo" results
#		   in "getFoo" and "setFoo".
#		x: A method, this has to be user implemented as
#		   "<class>.<method>()".
#		i: An init method that is called with the remaining parameters
#		   given to the constructor.
#		c: A cleanup method that is called before the reset or delete
#		   command, with the parameters given to them.
#		extends:
#		   This prefix is followed by the name of another class
#		   this class inherits methods and attributes from.
#		   Classes have to be given in the order of priority.
#
#		   The init and clean methods are inherited from the first
#		   class having them if no own init or clean method is
#		   supplied.
#
#		   The superInit() and superClean() methods also call
#		   the first encountered init and clean methods.
#		implements:
#		   This prefix is followed by the name of an interfaces.
#		   Interfaces define public methods that need to be implemented
#		   by a class to conform to the interface.
#
#	With these parameters a constructor and a destructor will be built.
#	It is important that all used attributes are listed, or the copy,
#	delete and serialization methods will not work as expected.
#
#	Everything that is not recognized as an identifier is treated as a
#	comment.
#
#	The prefixes r, w, x, i and c can be followed by a scope operator
#	public, protected or private.
#	
#	The constructor can be called in the following way:
#		<class> <refname>
#	The class name acts as the name of the constructor, <refname> is the
#	name of the variable to store the reference to the new object in.
#
#	The resetter deletes all attributes, this can be used to replace
#	an object. The resetter is called this way:
#		$reference.reset
#
#	The destructor can be called in the following way:
#		$reference.delete
#	This will destroy all methods and attributes.
#
#	A getter takes the name of the variable to store the value in as the
#	first argument, if this is ommitted, the value is written to stdout.
#
#	The copy method can be used to create a shallow copy of an object.
#
# @param bsda_obj_namespace
#	The frameowrk namespace to use when building a class. The impact is on
#	the use of helper functions.
# @return
#	0 on succes
#	1 if there is more than one init method (i:) specified
#	2 if there is more than one cleanup method (c:) specified
#	3 if there was an unknown scope operator
#	4 for an attempt to extend something that is not a class
#	5 for an attempt to implement something that is not an interface

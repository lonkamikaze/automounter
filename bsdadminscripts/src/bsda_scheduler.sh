# This class implements a sleeping process that can be used to lay a scheduler
# to rest for each run over the scheduler. This is useful to save CPU time.

# a Sleep object waits for the sleeping process to finish.
#
# The effect is that the given time is the maximum sleeping time between two
# run calls. If the time passed between two calls is greater than the sleeping
# interval, the process will not sleep at all.

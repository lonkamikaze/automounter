.Sh NAME
.Nm bsdadminscripts
.Nd perform administrative tasks
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
are a collection of scripts to deal with administrative tasks more
conveniently. Look at the respective manual pages to find out more.
.Ss BUILDFLAGS
Buildflags consists of a configuration syntax for the
.Xr make 1
system normally stored in a file called
.Xr buildflags.conf 1 ,
a converter called
.Xr buildflags.awk 1 ,
which converts the configuration file into make syntax and a make file
.Xr buildflags.mk 1 ,
which can be included into
.Xr make.conf 5
to use the buildflags system.
.Ss DISTVIPER
The distviper script wipes outdated files from the distdir. For this it
provides a fast mode that should be appropriate for most systems and a thorough
default that will also yield satisfying results on a dedicated build machine.
.Ss PKG_LIBCHK
The
.Xr pkg_libchk 1
script uses
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
.Xr ldd 1
and
.Xr readelf 1
to find packages that are linked against missing libraries or libraries that
reside in %%PREFIX%%/lib/compat and its subfolders.
.Ss PKG_UPGRADE
The
.Xr pkg_upgrade 1
script offers the possibility to perform binary only package maintenance
similar to tools for the FreeBSD ports tree, but only requiring a local copy
of the INDEX created by a build server.
.Ss PKG_VALIDATE
The
.Xr pkg_validate 1
script uses
.Xr pkg_info 1
to check for ports with checksum mismatches or missing files.
.Ss PORTCONFIG
The
.Xr portconfig 1
script runs make targets on the same ports that
.Xr portupgrade 1
would update.
.Ss RCSTART
The
.Xr rcstart 1
script allows you to handle
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts on the fly without
having to know the exact file name. Instead you select them by the PROVIDE
keyword.
.Ss UMA (Update MAnanager)
The
.Xr uma 1
script offers locking and meta data updating services for ports and package
maintenance.

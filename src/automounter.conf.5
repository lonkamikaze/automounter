.Dt AUTOMOUNTER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm automounter.conf
.Nd Define runtime parameters for automounter.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that gets sourced into the
.Xr automounter 8
script after the default settings have been defined. By overwriting variables
these settings can be changed.
.Pp
No checks are performed on these settings, it is the responsibility of the
system administrator to create a working configuration. For many systems
the defaults ought to be fine and a configuration file is not required
at all.
.Sh TOOL LOCATIONS
The locations of
.Xr amd 8 , Xr amq 8 , Xr rpcbind 8 , Xr rpcinfo 8 and Xr logger 1
can be configured. In addition to pointing to different locations this can be
used to call the tools with additional arguments.
.Sh AMD SETTINGS
The following variables can be used to control the behaviour of
.Xr amd 8 .
Please refer to that manual page for descriptions. The following will only
list the defaults unless the variables are further processed.
.Pp
Unless noted otherweise after changing any of these settings automounter has to
be restarted. Failing to do so can result in an inconsistent state.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It amd="%%AMD%%"
The location of the automounter daemon
.Xr amd 8 .
.It amq="%%AMQ%%"
The location of the automounter query tool
.Xr amq 8 .
.It a="%%RUN%%/automounter.amd"
.It c=4
.It w=2
.It l="%%RUN%%/automounter.amd.log"
.It directory="%%RUN%%/automounter.amd.mnt"
.It map="%%RUN%%/automounter.amd.map"
This is the location of the dynamically created map.
.It pidfile="%%RUN%%/automounter.amd.pid"
The PID file for
.Xr amd 8 .
Changing this will break the
.Xr rc 8
script.
.It static_map="%%MAP%%"
The map file that will be used to build the dynamic map from.
.Pp
For this setting to take effect an update call is sufficient.
.El
.Sh RPC SETTINGS
These settings only influence the startup of
.Xr amd 8 . The RPC daemon is a runtime dependency of
.Xr amd 8 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It rpcbind="%%RPCBIND%%"
The location of the RPC daemon
.Xr rpcbind 8 .
.It rpcinfo="%%RPCINFO%%"
The location of the RPC reporting tool
.Xr rpcinfo 8 .
.El
.Sh RUNTIME SETTINGS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It blacklist_devs
This variable can be used to exclude devices from automounting. The devices
are Shell-Patterns separated by ','.
.Pp
The following example excludes ATA disks and CD-/DVD-drives:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
blacklist_devs="ad*,acd*"
.Ed
.Pp
Changing blacklist_devs takes effect after an update call.
.It blacklist_nodes
This allows blacklisting by mount names. Like blacklist_devs it is a ','
separated list of Shell-Patterns. The following example blacklists all
ufs partitions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
blacklist_nodes="ufs/*"
.Ed
.Pp
Changing blacklist_nodes takes effect after an update call.
.It detect_glabel=1
If set to 0 or any other value not 1, discovering file systems through the
geom label class is deactivated.
.Pp
This setting takes effect with the next update call, excepting already mounted
file systems.
.It detect_iso9660=1
If set to 0 or any other value not 1, assuming that devices matching the
.Pa iso9660_devs
pattern are optical disk drives is turned off.
.Pp
This setting takes effect with the next update call, excepting already mounted
file systems.
.It detect_probe=1
If set to 0 or any other value not 1, discovering file systems through probing
is deactivated.
.Pp
This setting takes effect with the next update call, excepting already mounted
file systems.
.It devfs="%%DEVFS%%"
The location of the
.Xr devfs 5 .
This is required to know where to find the mount device nodes.
.Pp
This setting takes immediate effect.
.It evil_fuse=0
Setting this to 1 will activate a bug workaround for fuse based file systems
such as ntfs-3g from the sysutils/fusefs-ntfs port. Fuse closes all opened
files when an unmount is attempted. With automounter this happens every
five seconds by default.
.Pp
The workaround uses
.Xr fstat 1
to check whether files are opened on fuse based file systems and prevents
the unmount command from being run if this is the case. The downside is that
fstat is not able to see on which fuse file system the file is opened.
So all fuse file systems remain mounted until there are no more opened files
on any of them.
.Pp
As long as only one fuse based file system is in use there are no downsides
to using this workaround.
.Pp
The workaround takes immediate effect.
.It iso9660=cd9660
This is obligatory to mount optical discs.
.Pp
This setting takes immediate effect.
.It iso9660_devs="acd*,cd*"
This is a comma separated list of glob patterns. Devices matching one of the
patterns are assumed to be optical disk drives.
.Pp
Changes to this setting take effect with the next update call.
.It iso9660_options=ro
This is more appropriate for optical devices than the default mount options.
.Pp
This setting takes immediate effect.
.It linkdir="%%MEDIA%%"
The directory that will be populated with the links to
.Xr amd 8
mounts. It might be good to change this to avoid clashes with
.Xr hald 8 
based mounting solutions.
.Pp
It is recommended to stop automounter before changing this setting, because a
change would prevent automounter from cleaning up properly behind itself.
.It lock="%%RUN%%/automounter.lock"
A lock file that is used to prevent clashes between several instances of
.Xr automounter 8 ,
e.g. when there are several USB events at once.
.Pp
This takes immediate effect.
.It logger="%%LOGGER%%"
The
.Xr logger 1
command, reports messages to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
This can be replaced with an arbitrary command that accepts messages as
arguments and from
.Xr stdin 4 .
.Pp
Changes take immediate effect.
.It mount_options=rw,noatime,noexec
These are the default options given to mount when mounting a file system.
.Pp
This takes immediate effect.
.It mountdir="%%RUN%%/automounter.mnt"
A directory where
.Xr automounter 8
will create the mount points for amd.
.Pp
Like with linkdir it is required to stop automounter before changing mountdir
to avoid an inconsistent state.
.It nodes="%%VARTMP%%/automounter.nodes"
This file is used to remember which mounts are currently managed by
.Xr automounter 8 .
.Pp
It is required to stop automounter before changing nodes.
.It oldnodes="%%TMP%%/automounter.nodes.old"
A temporary file that is used to find out weather any mounts should be cleaned
up.
.Pp
A change of oldnodes takes immediate effect.
.It probe="%%TMP%%/automounter.probe"
A directory used for mount attempts to probe file system types of unlabeled
geom providers.
.Pp
Changing this takes immediate effect.
.It probed="%%TMP%%/automounter.probed"
A temporary file used to prevent the probing of geom providers whose labels
have been blacklisted.
.Pp
Changing this takes immediate effect.
.It screen="%%TMP%%/automounter.screen"
A file with a list of devices present for the last update. Unless the file
modification time is further in the past than the time specified by
.Va timeout ,
or the current device list differs,
.Xr devd 8
issued update calls are discarded.
.Pp
The device discovery activities of
.Nm automounter
may cause new devd events. This mechanism effectively prevents race
conditions.
.Pp
Changing this takes immediate effect.
.It probe_types=ufs,msdosfs,iso9660,ntfs,ext2fs
A comma separated list of file system types to automatically probe for.
.Pp
Changing probe_types takes effect with the next update call.
.It timeout=10
The time out for aquiring the lock. If the time out passes without gaining
the lock the instance of
.Xr automounter 8
is skipped.
.Pp
Changing the timeout takes immediate effect.
.El
.Sh FILE SYSTEM SPECIFIC SETTINGS
It is possible to influence the
.Fl t
and
.Fl o
parameters given to the mount command for each supported file system type.
.Pp
The parameter
.Fl t
defaults to the identified file system type. For optical drives the file system
type does not match the mount type, hence iso9660=cd9660 is set by default.
All mount types can be set similarly. The following example shows how
to use ntfs-3g to mount ntfs file systems.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ntfs=ntfs-3g
.Ed
.Pp
The parameter
.Fl o
defaults to mount_options, but it can be set individually for each
file system type. The following example will mount msdosfs file systems with
UTF-8 encoded file names:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
msdosfs_options=$mount_options,-L=en_GB.UTF-8
.Ed
.Pp
Changing these settings takes immediate effect.
.Pp
Note that more recent versions of FreeBSD have the
.Ar mountprog
option, which makes the
.Fl t
parameter obsolete in most cases. Read
.Xr mount 8
for details.
.Sh GELI
This section describes all settings related to
.Xr geli 8
key polling and auto attaching. Automounter should be stopped before any of
them are changed.
.Pp
New images and keys can be added any time. Images should not be removed while mounted.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It geli=0
By default all geli features are deactivated. To enable them this should be set
to 1.
.It geli_nodes="%%RUN%%/automounter.geli.nodes"
A file that is used to remember the device as which images were attached and
the key that was used for attaching.
.It geli_oldnodes="%%TMP%%/automounter.geli.oldnodes"
A temporary file that is used when removing stale attachments or adding new
ones.
.It geli_availablekeys="%%RUN%%/automounter.geli.keys"
A file for remembering the keys that are currently available.
.It geli_images="%%GELI_IMAGES%%"
The directory where images and device links are located.
.It geli_keys="%%GELI_KEYS%%"
The directory on managed file systems to poll for keys.
.El
